Opus UI was initially developed by [Intenda](https://intenda.tech/) as a low-code application development module for our flagship platform, [Fraxses](https://intenda.tech/fraxses-overview/). While it is still part of the Fraxses platform stack, we have made the decision to [open source Opus UI](blog/post?postId=0) as a library. 

Intenda was founded in 2001 and is a multinational software company with offices in the UK, EU and South Africa. Along with our teams in these locations, we have resources based in the USA and UAE. Our global customer base spans multiple regions and industries, including the public sector, banking, insurance, logistics, security, health, medical, petrochemical and retail.
