The lessons you can find here are in the process of being migrated to this website. They were built for use by Intenda employees but they are now being made available for public use.

Please note that while lesson videos are available, each lesson's exercise has not been added to this website yet.

Lastly, the first few lessons are only pertinent to Intenda employees and as such are not available on this here. Therefor the first lesson number is '4', not '1'.

# How to access the lesson dashboards and solutions
