# Conditionally rendering components

```info
secondaryBackground|This feature can be used when a component only needs to be rendered if some condition is met.

```gap
.
```divider
5px

# Example JSON

In this example, even though there are two icons defined, none will render due to their conditions not being met.

```codeJson
{
	"type": "containerSimple",
	"wgts": [
		{
			"type": "icon",
			"condition": {
				"operator": "isNotFalsy",
				"value": false
			},
			"prps": {
				"value": "home"
			}
		},
		{
			"id": "c1",
			"type": "containerSimple",
			"prps": {
				"showIcon": false
			},
			"wgts": [
				{
					"type": "icon",
					"condition": {
						"operator": "isEqual",
						"value": "{{state.c1.showIcon}}",
						"compareValue": true
					},
					"prps": {
						"value": "face"
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}

# Combining conditional components and conditional traits

Conditions can also be placed inside of traits. However, a condition can not be defined on a component as well as inside a trait that the component implements. In these cases, only the traitâ€™s condition will be applied. When this type of behavior is desired, conditions should instead be used in conjunction with conditional traits. That is, defining a on the trait implementation itself:

```codeJson
{
	"type": "containerSimple",
	"wgts": [
		{
			"type": "icon",
			"condition": {
				"operator": "isNotFalsy",
				"value": true
			},
			"traits": [
				{
					"trait": "./someTrait",
					"traitPrps": {},
					"condition": {
						"operator": "isNotFalsy",
						"value": true
					}
				}	
			]			
		}
	]
}
