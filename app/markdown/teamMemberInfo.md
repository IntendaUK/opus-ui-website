Shaun Kichenbrand
Developer at Intenda
When Shaun's dad taught him how to code in QBasic in primary school, he knew what he would be doing for the rest of his life. He's been involved in game development since shortly after birth and develops and runs a mildly successful open-source game called Isleward. He love solving problems for people through tech and believes that if a problem is too complex, you're solving the wrong problems first. His hobbies include playing guitar, reading, and listening to as much music as possible.

Santino Borzellino
Developer at Intenda
Santino's tech journey started early: From disabling monitoring software in primary school (to snag some gaming time during breaks), to tinkering with his family's PC (to figure out its inner workings and attempting to give it a speed boost). He's all about finding ways to boost efficiency and productivity, and is always researching new technologies. He's also responsible for reminding Shaun that that Vanilla JavaScript, while cool, isn't the only thing out there. When he's not coding, you'll likely catch him building water-cooled gaming rigs or travelling - exploring new cultures and cuisines is his favourite pastime outside of the tech world.
