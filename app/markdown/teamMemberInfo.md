Shaun Kichenbrand
Developer at Intenda
When Shaun's dad taught him how to code in QBasic in primary school, he knew what he would be doing for the rest of his life. He's been involved in game development since shortly after birth and develops and runs a mildly successful open-source game called Isleward. He love solving problems for people through tech and believes that if a problem is too complex, you're solving the wrong problems first. His hobbies include playing guitar, reading, and listening to as much music as possible.

Santino Borzellino
Developer at Intenda
Santino knew he wanted to get into tech from an early age. When he wasn't disabling monitoring software at primary school (to play games), he was taking apart their family computer (to make it faster...somehow). He's always trying to find ways to be more efficient and productive in how he works and is responsible for making sure Shaun remembers that Vanilla JavaScript, while cool, isn't the only thing out there. In his personal life, Saninto loves traveling and experiencing other cultures.
