# The Problem
In the example below, we have a containerSimple that swaps between visible and invisible when we click on the parent container. We'd expect the container inside inner to only have one child (extraWgt) and while this is the case the first time, each time we hide and show it (by clicking on the outer container) the amount of children increases by one.

This is because the parent container, when it mounts, sends the metadata for the children into ChildWgt without cloning it. Meaning that any objects/arrays inside it will get modified in place by Wrapper and the component itself.
```codeJson
{
	"id": "outer",
	"type": "container",
	"prps": {
		"singlePage": true,
		"canClick": true,
		"fireScript": {
			"actions": [
				{
					"type": "setState",
					"target": "inner",
					"key": "vis",
					"value": "{{eval.!{{state.inner.vis}}}}"
				}
			]
		}
	},
	"wgts": [
		{
			"id": "inner",
			"type": "containerSimple",
			"prps": {
				"vis": false
			},
			"wgts": [
				{
					"type": "container",
					"prps": {
						"scps": [
							{
								"actions": [
									{
										"type": "setState",
										"key": "extraWgts",
										"value": {
											"type": "containerSimple",
											"prps": {
												"width": 10,
												"height": 10,
												"backgroundColor": "red"
											}
										}
									}
								]
							}
						]
					}
				}
			]
		}
	]
}

# The Fix
In situations where you know a container will be re-mounted and that its extraWgts should 'start from scratch' every time, you need to set a new property on the container that needs to reset its children between re-mounts.
```codeJson
{
	"id": "inner",
	"type": "containerSimple",
	"prps": {
		"vis": false,
		"cloneChildrenBeforeMount": true
	}
}
```markdown
The 'cloneChildrenBeforeMount' property ensures that, before the inner container mounts its children, it clones them so that any changes made to them by Opus isn't persisted to the original children.
