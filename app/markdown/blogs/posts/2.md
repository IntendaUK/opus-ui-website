# The Problem
Imagine a scenario in which a developer has a button that adds a new component to 'extraWgts'. Said component has a scope called 'entry' and clicking on the **new** component causes its ID to be logged by accessing its scoped ID.

The first component that is mounted works as intended, but clicking again (and causing a second one to be mounted) causes an unintended side-effect: Clicking on it wil log the ID of the **first** component that was mounted. This is because scoped IDs are evaluated as soon as possible as an optimization. Since, by the time we want to mount the second one, another one is already mounted with the same scoped ID, our script immediately resolves to **that** ID. You can see this scenario in the example below:
```codeReact
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import Opus from '@intenda/opus-ui';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(
	<Opus
		startupMda={{
			type: 'container',
			prps: {
				canClick: true,
				fireScript: {
					actions: [{
						type: 'setState',
						key: 'extraWgts',
						value: [{
							scope: 'entry',
							type: 'container',
							prps: {
								canClick: true,
								fireScript: {
									actions: [{
										type: 'log',
										msg: '||entry||'
									}]
								}
							},
							wgts: [{
								relId: 'label',
								type: 'label',
								prps: {
									cpt: 'child'
								}
							}]
						}]
					}]
				}
			},
			wgts: [{
				type: 'label',
				prps: {
					cpt: 'Click to add a child'
				}
			}]	
		}}
	/>
);

# The Fix
To fix this, we introduced **Local Scoped IDs**. When specifying a scoped ID, we can prefix the scope with 'local' to indicate that the ID should **only** resolve to a parent of the component calling the script. Here is how the code looks after applying this change. Note that ||entry|| has now been rewritten to ||local.entry||:
```codeReact
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import Opus from '@intenda/opus-ui';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(
	<Opus
		startupMda={{
			type: 'container',
			prps: {
				canClick: true,
				fireScript: {
					actions: [{
						type: 'setState',
						key: 'extraWgts',
						value: [{
							scope: 'entry',
							type: 'container',
							prps: {
								canClick: true,
								fireScript: {
									actions: [{
										type: 'log',
										msg: '||local.entry||'
									}]
								}
							},
							wgts: [{
								relId: 'label',
								type: 'label',
								prps: {
									cpt: 'child'
								}
							}]
						}]
					}]
				}
			},
			wgts: [{
				type: 'label',
				prps: {
					cpt: 'Click to add a child'
				}
			}]	
		}}
	/>
);
